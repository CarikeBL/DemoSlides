# DemoSlides
My hub for slides presented at community events

In this space, I share the slides I have used to present at community events.

# The tools I used to build these slides include but are not limited to:
* PowerPoint (if that was not obvious) :)
* Figma Community Images
* AI-Generated Images
* Slides Go (for ppt templates)

See you at the next community event. Come and say hi :)
